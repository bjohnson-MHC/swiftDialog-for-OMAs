# swiftDialog for Overworked MacAdmins
Resources for the PSU MacAdmins 2025 session: swiftDialog for Overworked MacAdmins

## Scripts
- dialog-runNotifications.sh is a script for simply displaying a branded dialog window with a message and exiting.
- dialog-runChooser.sh is a script for displaying an initial branded dialog window with a user choice to continue or cancel, then a simple and updateable window to show while other script actions happen.
- (third script description)

## Images
- Blank-Banner-850x150-144.png is a banner image blank with a vertically centered rectangle to define the area of the image that the visible banner can be confined to, in order to avoid clipping when used with dialog.
- Blank-Icon-170x170-144.png is an icon or logo blank with a pixel density that won't look terrible when scaled on a retina screen.
